# Seasonal Sales

## Description
In this project I created a seasonal sales page for a department store. This project used XHR/JSON/JS and HTML. I created a webpage that displayed items from a .json file.

## How to run
In your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9898
```
Then navigate to [here](http://localhost:9999) in your browser.
